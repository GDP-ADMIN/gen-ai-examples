# Example Prompts

These are examples of prompts that are used together with GDP Labs GenAI SDK. The prompts are organized by module.

Each prompt example consists of a **system prompt** and a **user prompt**. They will be separated using XML tags. For example:

```
<System>
You are a {role}. Your task is to {description}.
</System>

<User>
User input: {query}
</User>
```
