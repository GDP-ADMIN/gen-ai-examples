# GenAI RAGO Example Using Source Code Version of SDK

This is an example of how to use the gllm-pipeline library to build a simple RAG pipeline using source code version of SDK.

See other examples in [gen-ai-examples](https://github.com/GDP-ADMIN/gen-ai-examples).

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Please refer to the centralized [prerequisites.md](../../prerequisites.md) file for detailed requirements to run this example.
>
> This example specifically requires:
> - Python v3.12
> - Access to GDP-ADMIN/gen-ai-internal repository
> - SSH Key configured in your GitHub Account
> - VSCode IDE

## Running the Code

1. Configure environment variables: copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set up your `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `LANGUAGE_MODEL`.

   - For Linux, macOS, or Windows WSL:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - For Windows Powershell or Command Prompt:

     ```powershell
     copy .env.example .env
     ```

2. Execute the script:

   - For Linux, macOS, or Windows WSL:

     ```bash
     ./local-start.sh
     ```

     > [!NOTE]
     > On Windows, you can either install [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) or execute the batch file in Windows Powershell or Command Prompt as described in the next section.

   - For Windows Powershell:

     ```powershell
     .\local-start.bat
     ```

   - For Windows Command Prompt:

     ```cmd
     local-start.bat
     ```

   The program will then wait for your question:

   > Question:

   Type your question and press enter. For example, you can try asking:

   ```
   What are the documents?
   ```

   The RAG pipeline will return the following response (more or less):

   > _The documents mentioned are referred to as Mock document 1, Mock document 2, and Mock document 3. However, without additional context or content from these documents, I cannot provide specific details about their contents or purposes._

3. Continue with steps in [Setting Python Interpreter Path in VSCode IDE](#setting-python-interpreter-path-in-vscode-ide)

## Setting Python Interpreter Path in VSCode IDE

Set up the Python interpreter path in your IDE by following these instructions:

> [!WARNING]
> You must complete the steps in [Running the Code](#running-the-code) until you see the `gen-ai-internal-hello-world example finished running.` on the console before continuing with the steps below on this section.

1. Open the code sample in VSCode and open [main.py](/examples/gen-ai-internal-hello-world/gen_ai_internal_hello_world/main.py) file.

   You might encounter import error like the screenshot below.

2.  After you run `./local-start.sh` using steps in [Running the Code](#running-the-code), you will see the log `Getting python interpreter path for use in IDE...` in the console. Copy the path in the next line, which looks something like:

    ```
    /home/<username>/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/gen-ai-internal-hello-world-ob4i36ef-py3.12/bin/python
    ```

3.  Open command palette (`âŒ˜+Shift+P` for Mac or `Ctrl+Shift+P` for Linux/Windows) and type `> Python: Select Interpreter` and press enter.

4.  Select `Enter interpreter path...`

    ![Enter interpreter path](img/image-enter-interpreter.png)

5.  Paste the previously copied path from the console and press enter.

    ![Setting up the path](img/image-enter-path.png)

Your IDE will then recognize the path and will no longer show red squiggly lines under the import statements. You can try hovering over them to see the details of the library.

## Troubleshooting

For common issues and their solutions, please refer to the centralized [FAQ document](../../faq.md).

Some issues specific to this example include:
- Unable to access repository GDP-ADMIN/gen-ai-internal
- Error executing component StuffResponseSynthesizer
- ImportError: failed to find libmagic (macOS/Windows)
- Unable to import 'gllm_generation.response_synthesizer'
